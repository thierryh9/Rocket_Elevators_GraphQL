This week, we used GraphQL to restore the data coming from two separate data sources in the same request.
Source 1: The Postgres decision database
Source 2: The MySQL operational database


QUESTIONS
  
  Question #1
* Retrieving the address of the building, the beginning and the end of the intervention for a specific intervention.
  What you need to put in Postman for the 1st Post.
    
    There is the Query you need to enter in Postman:
    
    {
    interventions(building_id: 3){

        end_intervention
        building_details{
            building_id
            infoValue

        }
        address{
